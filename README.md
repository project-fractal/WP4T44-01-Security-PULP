# WP4T44-01-Security-PULP

Security Services for PULP.

## Description

The goal of this component is to enhance the security features of the RISC-V platform provided by ETHZ.

Microarchitectural timing channels can be leveraged to transfer information across security boundaries. Instructions set architecture extensions for on-core time protection have been researched. 

## Objective

The component satisfies the objective of the task through: 
* Increasing the security featuresâ€¯of the RISC-V platform provided by ETHZ. In particular, the security extensions focuses on timing channels. 

## Prerequisites, Installation and Usage

Prerequisites, installation and usage described in the CVA6 repository.
